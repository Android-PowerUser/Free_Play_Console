# Free Play Developer Console
### Upload your apps freely to the Play Store

Anyone with Google Play Console has the ability to add a seemingly infinite number of users and connect users and apps through permissions.

To add a user, you need a Gmail address. You can add it here.

You will automatically receive an E-Mail from Google when you have been added to the Google Play Developer Console.

Please do not upload anything that violates Google's conditions, as I could lose my account without compensation. Since my personal information is stored and would have to be re-entered for a new account (which is then no longer possible), I have to sporadically check whether you are uploading apps or submissions that Google considers harmful.
Please do not abuse this! 

### "12-Tester-rule"

Google has illegally introduced a "12-tester-rule" for all non-business accounts. This applies to all accounts registered in the Play Console since November 13, 2023. Creating a business account involves significantly more effort. The "12-tester-rule" states that you must have at least 12 testers for 14 days for every app to be approved on the Play Store.
